# Ambient Sound Mixer - Complete Build Tutorial

Alright guys, I wanted to add another bonus project to this course. I know we created the tracalorie app which used a class-based object-oriented architecture, but I wanted to touch on that some more because I want you to really understand things like encapsulation, single responsibility, dependency injection, state management and just classes and objects in general.

## What We're Building

So what we'll be creating is an advanced ambient sound mixer where users can combine different nature sounds to create their perfect background atmosphere. This is the kind of app you'd actually use - for focus, relaxation, or sleep. Of course, we're going to build this with vanilla JavaScript. We will also be using the HTML5 Audio Element API. You could take it a step further and use the Web Audio API, which gives you all kinds of advanced audio capabilities like context, smooth fades, reverb, effects, however, we don't need that for what I'm trying to accomplish. And I want to focus mostly on code structure and patterns rather than a specific API.

## Project Features

Let's look at some of the features this project will have:

- Multiple simultaneous audio - Mix sounds like rain, ocean waves, and cafe sounds together
- Individual and master volume control
- User presets - Save your favorite combinations for instant access
- Sleep timer - Automatically stops after a set time
- Beautiful, responsive interface - Works on desktop and mobile

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** - Basic structure
- **Tailwind CSS (CDN)** - For rapid styling without writing CSS
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6 Modules)** - Modern JavaScript with proper code organization
- **HTML5 Audio Element API** - For playing, pausing and controling volume
- **Local Storage** - To save user presets
- **Font Awesome** - Icons

I will be including all the HTML and CSS as a template because we aren't going to type all that out. The Actual functioning of the application is what we care about.

## Why OOP?

So why did I select the OOP paradigm for this project?

- 500+ lines of mixed audio, UI, and data code
- Impossible to debug when something breaks
- No way to reuse code for similar projects
- A nightmare to maintain or add new features

Putting all this into one monolithic .js file would be an absolute mess. We will use classes to break our code into logical, reusable modules. Each class has one job and does it well. So OOP allows us to keep things separate and create clean, reusable code.

Let's get started.
